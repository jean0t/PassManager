# PasswordManager-Py

## An incredible Cli (and future Gui) password manager

*It has the capacity to cryptograph your data and keep it safe from others, since it will be kept safe in a secure database protected by a password.*

## Modules used:
- you are able to see in the 'requirements.txt' file

But the Python version used is 3.10.12 and the OS is linux (Ubuntu).
ps: not sure if it will work in windows, but i will work for it to happen in the future.
